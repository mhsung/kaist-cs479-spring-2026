## Time & Location
**Time**: Mon/Wed 1:00 p.m. - 2:15 p.m. (KST)   
**Location**: E3-5 Room 210


## Description
3D Data are widely used in many applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotic, such as autonomous driving, AI-assisted 3D object/scene design, augmented reality, and physical robot interaction. Along with the recent increasing demands on processing and analyzing such 3D data, there has been tremendous progress in developing novel technologies, especially based on deep learning. In this course, we will cover the recent advances in machine learning techniques for 3D data and also discuss the remaining challenges. 

## Prerequisites
### Required
- CS371: Introduction to Deep Learning
### Recommended
- CS380: Introduction to Computer Graphics
- CS484: Introduction to Computer Vision

## AI Coding Assistant Tool Policy
**You are allowed (and even encouraged) to utilize AI coding assistant tools**, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, and Code Intelligence, for your programming assignments and projects. Utilizing AI coding assistant tools will not be deemed as plagiarism. However, it is still strictly prohibited to directly copy code from the Internet or from someone else. Doing so will lead to a score of zero and a report to the university.
